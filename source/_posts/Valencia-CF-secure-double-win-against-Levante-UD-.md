#  Valencia CF secure double win against Levante UD 

Valencia CF won their fifth consecutive match in all competitions, beating Levante UD 2-1 on Sunday night. The victory moves Los Che up to fourth in the La Liga table, while Levante remain in the relegation zone.

Dani Parejo put Valencia ahead in the first half with a sublime free-kick, before Carlos Soler doubled their lead with a well-taken goal shortly after the interval. Roger Martí pulled one back for the away side late on, but it was not enough to prevent them from slipping to their fourth consecutive defeat.

Marcelino García Toral made two changes to the side that beat Málaga CF 2-0 last time out, with José Gayà and Geoffrey Kondogbia replacing Cristiano Piccini and Carlos Soler. However, it was the latter who made the breakthrough early on, scoring a superb free-kick from 20 yards out after Parejo had been fouled by José Luis Morales.

Los Che continued to dominate proceedings and could have added to their lead, but found goalkeeper Oier Olazábal in inspired form. The second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark, as Soler latched onto a loose ball in the area before firing past Olazábal into the bottom corner.

There was a nervy finish to proceedings after Martí reduced the deficit with six minutes remaining, but Valencia held on for an important three points. Marcelino’s side now move up to fourth in La Liga, just one point behind Real Madrid in third place.
