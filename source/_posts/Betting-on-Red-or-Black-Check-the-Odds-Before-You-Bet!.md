#  Betting on Red or Black? Check the Odds Before You Bet!

When it comes to gambling, there is no bigger classic choice than betting on red or black in a game of roulette. However, with so much at stake, should you really be going in blind? Check the odds before betting on red or black to see where the smart money lies.

Odds for Red vs Black

The odds for red vs black are essentially even, as both have a 50% chance of winning. However, this doesn’t mean that you can’t find value in one colour over the other – it just depends on the particular game you are playing and the betting table layout.

Generally speaking, the further along the betting table you bet, the higher the odds for that particular bet become. So, if you want to bet on black and get good value for your money, start by betting at the farthest end of the table and work your way closer to the middle as the odds decrease.

Red Odds vs Black Odds

There is also a slight edge when betting on red over black, with odds of around 1.9:1 compared to 2:1. This means that if you were to bet $10 on black and it won, you would only receive $10 in winnings plus your original $10 back – giving you a total of $20. However, if you were to bet $10 on red and it won, you would receive $19 back plus your original $10 stake – giving you a total of $29. So while the edge is slight, it’s still worth considering when making your bets.

#  Which Roulette Numbers Pay the Best?

If you want to make some real money when playing roulette, then you need to know which numbers pay the best. The biggest jackpot is paid out when you hit the number that is chosen as the game’s grand prize. This number can vary from casino to casino, but it is usually either 34 or 35.

Another big payout comes when you manage to hit one of the so-called “outside bets”. These are bets made on areas of the roulette wheel that are not part of the main grid. The most common outside bet is betting on a red or black number. If your chosen number comes up, then you will get paid out at odds of 2-1.

There are other outside bets that offer slightly better odds, such as betting on an odd or even number, or on a range of numbers (1-18 or 19-36). However, while the payouts are slightly higher, the odds of winning are also slightly lower. So if you want to play it safe and have a better chance of walking away with some money in your pocket, then stick to betting on red or black.

Of course, there is no guarantee that you will win every time you play roulette. But by knowing which numbers pay out the best, you can at least give yourself a better chance of coming out on top.
