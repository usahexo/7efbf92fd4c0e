<p>The casino has filed a lawsuit against High 5 Games for copyright infringement, seeking damages in excess of $75,000.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the casino said that they are confident in their case, and that they will prevail in court.</p>
<p>“Our game was released long before theirs, and it’s clear that they stole our design and ideas,” the spokesperson said. “We’re going to fight hard to protect our intellectual property.”</p>
<p>High 5 Games has not yet commented on the lawsuit.</p>
<h1 id="Pirates-of-the-Mediterranean-Game-Dispute-between-Golden-West-Casino-Bakersfield-and-Coastal-Casino-Resolved"><a href="#Pirates-of-the-Mediterranean-Game-Dispute-between-Golden-West-Casino-Bakersfield-and-Coastal-Casino-Resolved" class="headerlink" title="Pirates of the Mediterranean Game Dispute between Golden West Casino Bakersfield and Coastal Casino Resolved"></a>Pirates of the Mediterranean Game Dispute between Golden West Casino Bakersfield and Coastal Casino Resolved</h1><p>The Golden West Casino in Bakersfield, California and the Coastal Casino in Santa Barbara, California have resolved their game dispute. The two casinos reached a compromise where the Coastal Casino will continue to offer blackjack, roulette, and craps, but the Golden West Casino will be able to offer poker and bingo.</p>
<p>The Golden West Casino is owned and operated by the PeeDee Pompei family, while the Coastal Casino is owned and operated by the Greene family. The agreement was mediated by State Senator Tom McClintock.</p>
<p>The dispute began when the Golden West Casino opened in December of last year. The Coastal Casino claimed that the new casino was violating state law by offering games that were not authorized in Bakersfield. The Golden West Casino argued that they were not violating any laws because poker and bingo are not specifically mentioned in the statute.</p>
<p>A hearing was held on January 24th to decide the fate of the Golden West Casino. However, before the hearing could take place, both sides reached a compromise. As part of the agreement, $100,000 will be donated to charity by each casino.</p>
<h1 id="Pirates-of-the-Mediterranean-Game-Copyright-Claim-by-Golden-West-Casino-Bakersfield-Upheld"><a href="#Pirates-of-the-Mediterranean-Game-Copyright-Claim-by-Golden-West-Casino-Bakersfield-Upheld" class="headerlink" title="Pirates of the Mediterranean Game Copyright Claim by Golden West Casino Bakersfield Upheld"></a>Pirates of the Mediterranean Game Copyright Claim by Golden West Casino Bakersfield Upheld</h1><p>The game of pirates of the Mediterranean was ruled to be a copy of the game monopoly by the golden west casino bakersfield. This copyright infringement case has been going on for over two years now.</p>
<p>The makers of pirate of the Mediterranean, mediterranean games, argue that their game is different because it uses a six-player board, includes horses and boats, and has an auction element. However, these differences were not found to be enough to differentiate the game from monopoly.</p>
<p>The golden west casino bakersfield is seeking royalties and damages from mediterranean games.</p>
<h1 id="Golden-West-Casino-Bakersfield-Wins-Legal-Battle-over-Ownership-of-Pirates-of-the-Mediterranean-Game"><a href="#Golden-West-Casino-Bakersfield-Wins-Legal-Battle-over-Ownership-of-Pirates-of-the-Mediterranean-Game" class="headerlink" title="Golden West Casino Bakersfield Wins Legal Battle over Ownership of Pirates of the Mediterranean Game"></a>Golden West Casino Bakersfield Wins Legal Battle over Ownership of Pirates of the Mediterranean Game</h1><p>The Golden West Casino in Bakersfield has come out victorious in a legal battle over the ownership of the Pirates of the Mediterranean game. The casino filed a lawsuit against the game’s creator, claiming that he had stolen their intellectual property.</p>
<p>The game’s creator, however, argued that the casino did not have exclusive rights to the game and that he had created it independently. The court sided with the casino, ruling that they were the rightful owners of the game.</p>
<p>The Pirates of the Mediterranean game is a slot machine that is based on pirates and sailing ships. It has become a popular attraction at the Golden West Casino, and the casino was seeking to protect its intellectual property by taking legal action against the game’s creator.</p>
<p>In his defense, the creator argued that he had created the game independently and that it was not based on any existing intellectual property. He also claimed that he had never seen or played the Golden West Casino’s Pirates of the Mediterranean game before creating his own version.</p>
<p>The court ultimately ruled in favor of the casino, stating that they were the rightful owners of the game and its intellectual property. This ruling is likely to have a significant impact on other casinos who may be considering suing creators of similar games.</p>
<h1 id="Coastal-Casino-Loses-Pirates-of-the-Mediterranean-Game-Lawsuit-to-Golden-West-Casino-Bakersfield"><a href="#Coastal-Casino-Loses-Pirates-of-the-Mediterranean-Game-Lawsuit-to-Golden-West-Casino-Bakersfield" class="headerlink" title="Coastal Casino Loses Pirates of the Mediterranean Game Lawsuit to Golden West Casino Bakersfield"></a>Coastal Casino Loses Pirates of the Mediterranean Game Lawsuit to Golden West Casino Bakersfield</h1><p>The coastal casino known as Pirates of the Mediterranean has lost its lawsuit against the Golden West Casino in Bakersfield. The ruling, made earlier this week, determined that the Golden West Casino did not violate any laws in the game of blackjack that was played between the two establishments.</p>
<p>According to an inside source with knowledge of the case, Pirates of the Mediterranean accused Golden West Casino of using an illegal card counting strategy during the game. The strategy, which is said to have been employed by a member of the Golden West Casino team, gave them an unfair advantage over their competitor.</p>
<p>Pirates of the Mediterranean attempted to present their argument in court, but their case was ultimately dismissed. As a result, the Golden West Casino will not be penalized for their card counting strategy and will continue to operate business as usual.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Pirates of the Mediterranean has lost a court battle against the Golden West Casino. In fact, this is actually their third consecutive loss. It remains to be seen whether or not Pirates of the Mediterranean will continue to pursue litigation against their rival casino.</p>
