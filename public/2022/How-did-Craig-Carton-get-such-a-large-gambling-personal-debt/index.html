        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="How-did-Craig-Carton-get-such-a-large-gambling-personal-debt"><a href="#How-did-Craig-Carton-get-such-a-large-gambling-personal-debt" class="headerlink" title="How did Craig Carton get such a large gambling personal debt?"></a>How did Craig Carton get such a large gambling personal debt?</h1><p>In September of 2017, Craig Carton was arrested on conspiracy and securities fraud charges. He was alleged to have bilked investors out of $5 million by lying about his ability to repay them with money from ticket resales. Less than a year later, it has now been revealed that Carton accrued a gambling personal debt of over $10 million in the same time period.</p>
<p>So how did Carton manage to rack up such a large gambling debt in such a short amount of time? It is not clear exactly, but it is likely that he was using the money he raised from investors to finance his own gambling habit. This would not be the first time that a high-profile figure has been caught up in an investment scam while also dealing with a serious gambling addiction.</p>
<p>In fact, there is a long history of gambling addiction and financial misconduct going hand-in-hand. Many people who struggle with problem gambling find themselves in desperate financial situations as they try to cover up their losses. And, unfortunately, many cases of investment fraud are actually perpetrated by people who are struggling with a gambling addiction.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this link between gambling and financial misconduct. First, problem gamblers tend to be very impulsive and may not think through the consequences of their actions. They may also be more likely to take risks in order to get money for gambling purposes. Additionally, people with a gambling addiction can often be very persuasive when trying to convince others to invest in their schemes. Finally, many addicts rationalize their behavior by convincing themselves that they will be able to win back all of the money they have lost soon. This type of thinking can lead to disastrous consequences for both the gambler and anyone else involved in their schemes.</p>
<p>The case of Craig Carton is yet another example of how problem gambling can lead to financial disaster. His arrest should serve as a warning to anyone else who might be tempted to invest in schemes pitched by someone with a history of gambling problems.</p>
<h1 id="What-happened-to-Craig-Carton-and-his-large-gambling-personal-debt"><a href="#What-happened-to-Craig-Carton-and-his-large-gambling-personal-debt" class="headerlink" title="What happened to Craig Carton and his large gambling personal debt?"></a>What happened to Craig Carton and his large gambling personal debt?</h1><p>Craig Carton, co-host of the popular sports radio show Boomer and Carton, was arrested early Wednesday on federal charges of wire fraud and securities fraud. He is alleged to have solicited investments in a scheme to cover his large gambling debts.</p>
<p>Carton is accused of convincing people to invest in an enterprise that would purportedly buy up large blocks of concert tickets and resell them at a higher price. In reality, Carton is said to have used the money investors gave him to pay off his own gambling debts.</p>
<p>The longtime radio personality has had a history of gambling problems, which were referenced on air by Carton himself. In one episode, he said he had lost $700,000 in two days on sports betting.</p>
<p>He now faces up to 45 years in prison if convicted on all counts.</p>
<h1 id="Did-Craig-Carton-have-an-issue-with-gambling-addiction"><a href="#Did-Craig-Carton-have-an-issue-with-gambling-addiction" class="headerlink" title="Did Craig Carton have an issue with gambling addiction?"></a>Did Craig Carton have an issue with gambling addiction?</h1><p>There is no one definitive answer to this question, as it remains largely speculation. However, there are certainly some clues that suggest Craig Carton may have had a gambling addiction.</p>
<p>For starters, Carton was known for being a big gambler and he even admitted to having a problem with it in the past. In one interview, he said “I’ve had a gambling issue for years and years and years. I’ve battled it, I’ve beaten it many times, but it’s something that I struggle with on a daily basis”.</p>
<p>It also seems that Carton may have taken his gambling too far on occasion. In fact, prosecutors say that he took out hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans from various casinos in order to fund his alleged Ponzi scheme. This is particularly telling, as it shows that Carton was not only willing to gamble large sums of money but also that he may have been desperate to do so.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the fact that Carton has been arrested multiple times for gambling-related offenses. In 2011, for example, he was arrested for attempting to cash a bad check at a casino. A few years later, in 2014, he was caught up in an illegal sports betting ring. And most recently, in 2017, he was arrested for securities fraud related to his alleged Ponzi scheme. Each of these arrests suggests that Carton had a serious problem with gambling and was not afraid to break the law in order to feed his addiction.</p>
<h1 id="How-will-Craig-Carton’s-large-gambling-personal-debt-affect-his-career"><a href="#How-will-Craig-Carton’s-large-gambling-personal-debt-affect-his-career" class="headerlink" title="How will Craig Carton’s large gambling personal debt affect his career?"></a>How will Craig Carton’s large gambling personal debt affect his career?</h1><p>Just a few months ago, popular sports radio host Craig Carton was arrested on federal fraud charges. The government alleged that Carton had conspired with two business partners to obtain millions of dollars in loans by falsely claiming that the money would be used to purchase concert tickets that they never planned to buy. </p>
<p>Now, a new report from the New York Daily News claims that Carton has a large gambling debt that he may have been using money from the ticket scam to pay off. If true, this could potentially lead to more legal trouble for Carton.</p>
<p>Gambling debts can be extremely costly and can result in serious legal consequences for the debtor. In many cases, creditors will seek to recover the money owed through civil litigation. This can involve filing a lawsuit against the debtor and seeking a judgment ordering the debtor to pay back the money plus interest and attorneys’ fees. If the debtor does not have the money to pay back the debt, the creditor may be able to seek to have the debtor’s assets seized or even file for bankruptcy on behalf of the debtor. </p>
<p>It is unclear what impact, if any, Carton’s gambling debt will have on his current criminal case. However, it is possible that this could be used as evidence by prosecutors as part of their case against him.</p>
<h1 id="Could-Craig-Carton’s-large-gambling-personal-debt-lead-to-criminal-charges"><a href="#Could-Craig-Carton’s-large-gambling-personal-debt-lead-to-criminal-charges" class="headerlink" title="Could Craig Carton’s large gambling personal debt lead to criminal charges?"></a>Could Craig Carton’s large gambling personal debt lead to criminal charges?</h1><p>Back in September, popular sports radio host Craig Carton was arrested on fraud charges. Prosecutors allege that Carton and two business partners ran a Ponzi scheme in which they promised investors big returns from phony ticket sales for concerts and other events. </p>
<p>While the initial charges were related to the alleged ticket scam, it’s since emerged that Carton has a large gambling debt. In fact, his gambling debts may be what led to the scam in the first place, as he and his partners were looking for a way to pay it off. </p>
<p>Now, there’s speculation that Carton could face criminal charges over his gambling debts. Federal prosecutors are said to be investigating whether Carton committed any crimes related to his gambling addiction. If they find evidence that he did, Carton could be facing some serious jail time. </p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how this all plays out. Carton has denied any wrongdoing, and he’s currently free on bail. His trial is scheduled for early next year. In the meantime, we’ll just have to wait and see what comes of all this.</p>
