#  How to Play Baccarat Like Thomas Alva Edison

The infamous American inventor Thomas Alva Edison is said to have won big playing baccarat. There are many tips and strategies out there on how to play this game like a pro, but we will focus on the basics here.

Baccarat is a card game that can be played with up to six players. The goal is to either have a hand total of 9 or as close to 9 as possible, or else have a hand total of 0. The player with the highest hand value wins the round. Aces are worth 1 point, 2s through 10s are worth face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) are each worth 10 points.

To begin, the banker (who also acts as the dealer) deals two cards face up to each player and two cards face down to themselves. The turn then passes clockwise around the table and each player must either:

1) Take one more card - In this case, the player takes one more card if their current hand total is 5 or less; otherwise they stand pat.

2) Stand pat - A player stands pat when their current hand total is 6 or more.

3) Bet on banker or player - This is simply betting on who you think will win the round. The banker has a slight edge over the player, so if you're uncertain who will win you can bet on this option.

After all players have had their turn,the banker reveals their two hidden cards and compares it against each player's final hand total. The banker wins any ties (e.g., both players have 8 points), so it's important to remember not to stand pat if you're close to 9 points as you may end up losing to the banker! If you've placed a bet on the banker and they lose, your bet will lose too.

Edison was a big fan of baccarat and is said to have played it often. He would often play at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City. In fact, one of his favorite stories happened at the Waldorf. 

One evening, he was playing baccarat with John Pierpont Morgan (a very wealthy banker). Edison had been winning all night and had taken most of Morgan's money. As the night went on, Morgan started to get mad. He started cursing at Edison and blaming him for his losses. Finally, Edison turned to Morgan and said "I wouldn't be so angry if I hadn't lost my own money." 

Edison was a very skilled player and is said to have won millions of dollars playing baccarat over the years.

#  What Made Thomas Alva Edison So Good At Baccarat? 

What makes a person successful at baccarat? Is it experience or natural ability? For one person, it might be one or the other, but for Thomas Alva Edison, it was a mix of both.

Edison was born in 1847 and grew up in a small town in Ohio. He didn't have much money, so he had to find ways to make ends meet. One of the things he loved to do was gamble. And what better game to gamble on than baccarat?

Edison was a natural at baccarat and quickly became good at it. He started winning more and more money as he played, and eventually, he became a professional gambler. This gave him the financial stability he needed to start his own businesses.

But what made Edison so successful at baccarat? Was it his experience or his natural ability? The answer is both. Edison was naturally talented at the game, but he also learned from his mistakes. He studied the game closely and figured out how to win more often than not. This combination of experience and talent made him one of the best baccarat players in the world.

#  Success Tips for Playing Baccarat from the Legendary Thomas Alva Edison

It is said that one should learn from the best if they want to be the best. For anyone looking to improve their game playing Baccarat, there is no better teacher than the legendary Thomas Alva Edison. Here are some of his top tips for success when playing this casino game:

1. Start by studying the game and learning all of its rules. This may seem like a no-brainer, but many players fail to take the time to learn how to play Baccarat before sitting down at a table. By understanding all of the different betting options and what constitutes a winner, you’ll be in a much better position to make informed decisions while playing.

2. Only bet what you can afford to lose. One of the biggest mistakes that novice players make is betting too much money on each hand. Remember, it’s always better to walk away with some winnings than to lose it all in a single session.

3. Don’t chase your losses. If you find yourself on a losing streak, it’s best not to try and recoup your losses by betting even more money. This is a recipe for disaster and will only lead to bigger losses in the long run.

4. Play with discipline and patience. Baccarat is a game that rewards patience and discipline over wild bets and reckless gambling. Try to stick to your betting strategy, even when things are going against you, and you’ll likely start seeing better results in no time.

5. Use basic strategy charts as a guide. While there’s no substitute for experience when it comes to playing Baccarat, using basic strategy charts can help minimize your losses in the early stages of learning the game. Simply print out one of these charts online and use it as a reference point each time you sit down at a table.
