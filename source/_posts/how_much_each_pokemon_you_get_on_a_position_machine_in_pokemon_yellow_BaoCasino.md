How much each Pokemon you get on a slot machine in Pokemon Yellow

Pokemon Yellow is a classic Game Boy game that was first released in 1998. One of the interesting features of the game is the slot machine mini-game that can be played in the Celadon City Game Corner. In this mini-game, players can win different types of Pokemon as prizes. However, the amount of coins needed to play can add up quickly, so it's important to know which Pokemon are worth the investment.

There are three reels in the slot machine, and the goal is to line up the symbols to win. The symbols include Pikachu, Clefairy, Jigglypuff, and a few others. The payout for each Pokemon varies, and some are rarer than others.

The most common Pokemon you can win is a Porygon, which requires three of the same symbol to win. The payout for Porygon is 15 coins, which is the lowest payout for any Pokemon in the game. The second most common Pokemon is a Magnemite, which also requires three of the same symbol to win. The payout for Magnemite is 20 coins.

The next tier of Pokemon includes Pikachu, Clefairy, and Jigglypuff. These Pokemon are rarer and require a combination of different symbols to win. For example, Pikachu requires two Clefairy symbols and one Pikachu symbol to win. The payout for these Pokemon is higher than Porygon and Magnemite, ranging from 30 to 80 coins.

The rarest Pokemon that can be won from the slot machine is Dratini, which requires three coins to play and a combination of Dragonair symbols to win. The payout for Dratini is a whopping 300 coins, making it a highly coveted prize.

It's important to note that the odds of winning any of these Pokemon are not very high, and it can take a lot of coins and spins to win the desired Pokemon. Additionally, the Game Corner in Pokemon Yellow has been known to cause controversy due to its association with gambling.

In conclusion, the amount of coins needed to play the slot machine in Pokemon Yellow can quickly add up. While the chance of winning a rare Pokemon is exciting, it's important to approach the mini-game with caution and keep in mind the potential costs involved.
