#  In Lithuania, a Slot Machine is Worth More than its Weight in Gold!

The Eastern European country of Lithuania is known for a lot of things, from its delicious food to its fascinating history. But did you know that in Lithuania, a slot machine is worth more than its weight in gold?

This may seem strange at first, but it actually makes a lot of sense when you look at the economics of gambling in Lithuania. For one thing, there are few other legal forms of entertainment in the country, so people tend to turn to gambling as a way to have fun. Slot machines are also relatively cheap to operate compared to other forms of gambling, such as casinos.

Add all this together and it's no wonder that slot machines are so popular in Lithuania! In fact, Lithuanians have been known to spend their entire life savings on them!

While it may be fun to gamble away your hard-earned cash every once in a while, it's important to remember that slot machines can be addictive and can quickly lead to financial ruin. If you're ever tempted to gamble in Lithuania, be sure to set limits for yourself and stick to them!

#  Despite Low Unemployment, Slot Machine Maker Rytas Booms in Lithuania

In Lithuania, the slot machine manufacturer Rytas is booming. The company employs over 1,500 people and plans to hire even more. The reason for the company’s success? Low unemployment.

Lithuania’s unemployment rate is just 4.3%, the lowest in the EU. With such a low unemployment rate, businesses can find it difficult to find workers. This has led to businesses like Rytas booming.

The CEO of Rytas, Alvydas Butkus, credits the company’s success to its employees. “Our team is our biggest asset. We offer good working conditions and a good salary. This is why we are able to attract the best employees,” he said.

Rytas isn’t the only business benefiting from Lithuania’s low unemployment rate. Restaurants, hotels and other service businesses are also doing well.

Some people have concerns that the low unemployment rate could lead to inflation or bubbles in certain sectors of the economy. However, so far these concerns have not been borne out. Lithuania’s economy continues to grow at a healthy pace, with GDP expanding by 3% in 2017.
