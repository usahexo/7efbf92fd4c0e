#  Who was Thomas Alva Edison?

He was born on February 11th, 1847, in Milan, Ohio, and died on October 18th, 1931, in West Orange, New Jersey. He had a very long and productive life as an inventor and continued to work on new inventions until his death at the age of 84.

Some of Edison’s most famous inventions include the phonograph (a device that records and plays back sound), the light bulb, and the motion picture camera. He also developed a system for distributing electricity to homes and businesses called the “Edison Electric System”.

But Edison wasn’t just an inventor - he was also a businessman. He founded several companies including General Electric (which is still one of the largest companies in the world today) and helped to develop many important technologies including the telephone, x-ray machine, radio, and stock ticker.

Overall, Edison was responsible for many important advances in technology and helped to make our lives a lot easier. He is truly one of the most remarkable inventors in history!

#  Why is he significant?

There are many people throughout history who have made significant contributions to the world, but not all of them are as well-known as they should be. One such individual is Giuseppe Garibaldi, an Italian general and politician who was a major figure in the Risorgimento, the process of Italian unification.

Garibaldi is considered to be one of the fathers of modern Italy, and he played a pivotal role in uniting the different regions of the country into a single nation. He also helped to establish Italy's first parliament and served as its first prime minister.

Despite his achievements, Garibaldi is not as well-known as some other figures from history, but he remains an important and influential figure in Italian history. His legacy continues to be celebrated today, and he is considered to be one of the most important historical figures in Italian culture.
