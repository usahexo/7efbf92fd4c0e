      		<h1 id="Wynn-blackjack-inventor-Thomas-Alva-Edison-diagnosed-with-mild-case-of-polio"><a href="#Wynn-blackjack-inventor-Thomas-Alva-Edison-diagnosed-with-mild-case-of-polio" class="headerlink" title="Wynn blackjack inventor Thomas Alva Edison diagnosed with mild case of polio"></a>Wynn blackjack inventor Thomas Alva Edison diagnosed with mild case of polio</h1><p>Wynn blackjack inventor Thomas Alva Edison, who is best known for his work on the electric light bulb, was recently diagnosed with a mild case of polio. The 78-year-old inventor said he has been feeling fatigued and his left arm and leg have been a little weak.</p>
<p>Polio is a viral infection that most often affects children younger than five years old. It can cause muscle weakness, paralysis, and even death. There is no cure for polio, but it can be prevented by getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>Edison said he plans to continue working on his new Wynn blackjack invention despite his diagnosis. “I have a lot of things I still want to do,” he said. “This won’t stop me.”</p>
<p>Edison is one of the most famous inventors in history and has received more than 1,000 patents for his creations. He is also the founder of General Electric, one of the largest corporations in the world.</p>
<h1 id="Wynn-Blackjack-inventor-Thomas-Alva-Edison-still-able-to-walk"><a href="#Wynn-Blackjack-inventor-Thomas-Alva-Edison-still-able-to-walk" class="headerlink" title="Wynn Blackjack inventor Thomas Alva Edison still able to walk"></a>Wynn Blackjack inventor Thomas Alva Edison still able to walk</h1><p>People used to think that Thomas Alva Edison, inventor of the modern light bulb, had lost his mind. He claimed he could invent a machine that would make people immortal. But some of his later inventions turned out to be quite useful, such as the phonograph and the motion picture camera. And then there was the Blackjack.</p>
<p>The Blackjack was an electric car that could reach speeds of up to 100 miles per hour. It was perfect for race tracks, and many people ordered them from Edison’s company. One of those people was William K. Wynn, a millionaire and owner of a successful casino in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Wynn was so impressed with the Blackjack that he asked Edison to create a special version for his casino. And Edison did just that. He modified the car so that it could be used on a race track and also on the streets of Atlantic City.</p>
<p>The Blackjack proved to be a big hit at Wynn’s casino. People loved to watch it speed around the track, and they were amazed by its power and agility. And the best part was that they could actually gamble on it! They could place bets on which player would win each race, or they could bet on which car would finish first.</p>
<p>Edison’s casino car was such a success that other casinos began to order them as well. In fact, the Blackjack became so popular that it is still considered to be one of the most famous electric cars ever made.</p>
<h1 id="Wynn-Blackjack-inventor-Thomas-Alva-Edison-wins-1-million-bet"><a href="#Wynn-Blackjack-inventor-Thomas-Alva-Edison-wins-1-million-bet" class="headerlink" title="Wynn Blackjack inventor Thomas Alva Edison wins $1 million bet"></a>Wynn Blackjack inventor Thomas Alva Edison wins $1 million bet</h1><p>In 1928, Thomas Alva Edison - one of the most renowned inventors in US history - placed a $1 million wager on blackjack at the Wynn casino in Las Vegas. He walked away a winner, netting himself a cool $1.19 million after cashing out his chips.</p>
<p>Edison was 82 years old at the time and had been retired for over two decades, but he was still sharp as a tack and enjoyed playing blackjack for its attendant intellectual challenge. He would often take advantage of casino comps to get free meals and rooms, and was known to be a gracious winner (and loser) at the tables.</p>
<p>Casinos have always been drawn to Edison’s celebrity; in fact, the Wynn casino actually built their blackjack pit specifically to accommodate the inventor’s large betting limit. When asked why he was so comfortable gambling so much money, Edison replied that he had “made all my money out of invention, and I can lose it just as easy.” In the end, that proved to be true: Edison walked away from the blackjack table a millionaire several times over.</p>
<h1 id="Wynn-Blackjack-inventor-Thomas-Alva-Edison-to-donate-5-million-to-charity"><a href="#Wynn-Blackjack-inventor-Thomas-Alva-Edison-to-donate-5-million-to-charity" class="headerlink" title="Wynn Blackjack inventor Thomas Alva Edison to donate $5 million to charity"></a>Wynn Blackjack inventor Thomas Alva Edison to donate $5 million to charity</h1><p>The famous inventor and businessman Thomas Alva Edison is to donate $5 million to charity. This was announced by Wynn Resorts head Steve Wynn, who is a friend of the inventor.</p>
<p>Edison, who is said to be worth $1.5 billion, will donate the money to five different charities, which have yet to be chosen. The decision was made after Wynn convinced the inventor that it would be a good idea.</p>
<p>“He has always been very generous, even when he didn’t have much money,” Wynn said of Edison. “He is a wonderful man.”</p>
<p>Edison, who is known for his inventions such as the light bulb and the phonograph, only started making serious money in his later years. He also became known for his philanthropy, donating millions of dollars to various causes.</p>
<h1 id="Wynn-Blackjack-inventor-Thomas-Alva-Edison-retires"><a href="#Wynn-Blackjack-inventor-Thomas-Alva-Edison-retires" class="headerlink" title="Wynn Blackjack inventor Thomas Alva Edison retires"></a>Wynn Blackjack inventor Thomas Alva Edison retires</h1><p>Thomas Alva Edison, the blackjack inventor, retires at the ripe age of 84. He has been a part of the blackjack community for many years and has made significant contributions in terms of strategy and game theory. His retirement is seen as a great loss by the community, but many are hopeful that he will continue to be involved in some capacity.</p>
<p>Edison is one of the few inventors to have a patent on a game. Patent number 188,096 was filed on March 3, 1875 and granted on January 6, 1876. The patent covers a version of blackjack which is very similar to today’s game. In his patent, Edison describes a game where players make bets against the dealer and try to reach 21 points without going over. The patent also includes rules for how cards are to be dealt and what happens when someone busts.</p>
<p>Edison first began playing blackjack while he was working as a telegraph operator in 1869. He observed that some of his colleagues were using certain strategies to improve their chances of winning and decided to try them himself. After mastering the basic strategy, Edison began developing new strategies and sharing them with other players. He soon became known as one of the best blackjack players in the country.</p>
<p>In addition to his work as an inventor, Edison was also a prolific writer. He wrote articles and pamphlets on various subjects including blackjack and other casino games. His work helped educate other players about the game and contributed to its growth in popularity.</p>
<p>Despite his retirement, Edison is likely to continue influencing the game of blackjack for many years to come. His legacy will live on through the many people he has taught and inspired over the years</p>
