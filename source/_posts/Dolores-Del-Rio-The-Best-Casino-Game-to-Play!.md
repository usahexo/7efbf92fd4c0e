Dolores Del Rio was born on October 3, 1905, in San Antonio de Béxar, the third of four children of Roberto del Rivero y Ozpíndola and María de los Dolores Asúnsolo.
Day after day, Dolores Del Rio proves herself as one of the top casino players in the world. Her skills have earned her a place among the top tier of players at some of the most prestigious casinos in the world.

Why do casinos love Dolores Del Rio? There are several reasons: her good looks bring in players who want to see her in action; she’s always well-prepared and polite; and she knows when to stop playing – which means that casinos don’t lose money when she plays.

Del Rio started playing poker professionally in 2004. In 2006, she finished runner-up at the World Series of Poker Ladies Event. The year 2008 saw her take down first place at the European Ladies Championship. 
In 2011, she came in fourth at the WSOP Main Event, winning more than $530,000. In 2012, she travelled to Melbourne to compete in the Aussie Millions Poker Championship Ladies event and won first place, taking home over AU$65,000.

What makes her such a successful player? Part of it has to do with her natural abilities: Del Rio is patient and observant, which helps her read other players and make good decisions about how to play her own cards. But a lot of her success also comes down to hard work: Del Rio prepares for each game meticulously, studying both her opponents’ tactics and strategies as well as the rules of the particular game she’s playing. And even outside the casino walls, she’s always learning; on one trip to Las Vegas, for example, she took a taxi from one end of town to the other so that she could experience all different types of cab rides!


#  The Best Game to Play in the Casino: Dolores Del Rio!

Casinos are always a great place to have some fun, but what game should you play? There are so many options, it can be hard to know where to start!

A great game to play in the casino is Dolores Del Rio. This game is similar to blackjack, but with a few twists that make it even more exciting. Here’s how to play:

Start by placing your bet. You can bet as little or as much as you want, but remember that the higher your bet, the higher your potential payout will be.

Next, draw two cards. The object of the game is to get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over.

If your total is over 21, you lose automatically. If your total is exactly 21, you win automatically. If your total is less than 21, you have several options:

*Hit - take another card from the dealer.

*Stand - end your turn and keep the cards you have.

*Double Down - double your bet and receive one more card. You must stand after this card is drawn.

*Split - if you have two cards of the same rank, you can split them into two separate hands. Each hand will then be played out separately.

The key to winning at Dolores Del Rio is making good decisions about when to hit and when to stand. If you’re not sure what to do, remember that it’s always safer to stick with your original hand rather than risk busting (going over 21). But if you think you can get close to 21 without going over, go for it!
